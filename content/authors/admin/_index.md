Marilyn Horta is a postdoctoral fellow in the University of Florida NIDA T32 Program. Her primary goal as a developmental psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist is to conduct rigorous research that can lead to the development of effective interventions that promote greater health and independence in old age. She is particularly interested in characterizing developmental trajectories of social cognition and health-related behaviors, including identifying potential age-related deficits and ways to optimize function in
these domains. Currently, she investigates neurobiological and psychosocial contributors to chronic pain and substance use. She employs an integrative biopsychosocial
methodological approach to research, which leverages biological sampling, self-report and experimental measures, and neuroimaging.
