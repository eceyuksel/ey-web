abstract: Aging is associated with increased difficulty in facial emotion
  identification, possibly due to age-related network change. The neuropeptide
  oxytocin (OT) facilitates emotion identification but this is understudied in
  aging. To determine the effects of OT on dynamic facial emotion identification
  across adulthood, 46 young and 48 older participants self-administered
  intranasal OT or a placebo (P) in a randomized, double-blind procedure. Older
  participants were slower and less accurate in identifying emotions. Although
  there was no behavioral treatment effect, partial least squares (PLS) analysis
  supported treatment effects on brain patterns during emotion identification
  that varied by age and emotion. For young participants, OT altered the
  processing of sadness and happiness, while for older participants OT only
  affected the processing of sadness (15.3% covariance, p = 0.004). Further,
  seed PLS analysis showed that older participants in the OT group recruited a
  large-scale amygdalar network that was positively correlated for anger, fear,
  and happiness whereas older participants in the P group recruited a smaller,
  negatively correlated network (7% covariance, p = 0.002). Advancing the
  literature, these findings show that OT alters brain activity and amygdalar
  connectivity by age and emotion.
