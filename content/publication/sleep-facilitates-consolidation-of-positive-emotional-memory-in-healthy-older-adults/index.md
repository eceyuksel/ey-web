abstract: Evidence has demonstrated that sleep-related memory consolidation
  declines in ageing. However, little is known about age-related changes to
  sleep-related emotional memory consolidation, especially when considering the
  positivity effect observed in older adults. In the present study, we sought to
  explore whether there is a positive emotional bias in sleep-related memory
  consolidation among healthy older adults. Young and older adults were randomly
  assigned either into a sleep or wake condition. All participants encoded
  positive, negative, and neutral stimuli and underwent recognition tests
  immediately (test 1), after a 12-hour sleep/wake interval (test 2), and 3 days
  after test 2 (test 3). Results showed that age-related differences of sleep
  beneficial effect were modulated by emotion valence. In particular, sleep
  selectively enhanced positive memory in older adults, while in young adults
  sleep beneficial effect was manifested in neutral memory. Moreover, the sleep
  beneficial effect can be maintained at least 3 days in both young and older
  adults. These findings suggest that older adults had preserved but positive
  bias of sleep-related memory consolidation, which could be one of the
  underlying mechanisms for their generally better emotional well-being in daily
  life. These findings highlight the dynamic interplay among sleep and emotional
  memory in older adults.
