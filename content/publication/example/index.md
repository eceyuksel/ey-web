abstract: Attending to and understanding one’s own feelings are components of
  meta-mood and constitute important socio-affective skills across the entire
  lifespan. Growing evidence suggests a neuromodulatory role of the neuropeptide
  oxytocin on various socio-affective processes. Going beyond previous work that
  almost exclusively examined young men and perceptions of emotions in others,
  the current study investigated effects of intranasal oxytocin on meta-mood in
  young and older men and women. In a double-blind between-group design,
  participants were randomly assigned to self-administer either intranasal
  oxytocin or a placebo before responding to items from the Trait Meta-Mood
  Scale about attention to feelings and clarity of feelings. In contrast to
  older women, oxytocin relative to placebo increased attention to feelings in
  older men. Oxytocin relative to placebo enhanced meta-mood in young female
  participants but reduced it in older female participants. This pattern of
  findings supports an age- and sex-differential modulatory function of the
  neuropeptide oxytocin on meta-mood, possibly associated with neurobiological
  differences with age and sex.
