abstract: Crying is the principal means by which newborn infants shape parental
  behavior to meet their needs. While this mechanism can be highly effective,
  infant crying can also be an aversive stimulus that leads to parental
  frustration and even abuse. Fathers have recently become more involved in
  direct caregiving activities in modern, developed nations, and fathers are
  more likely than mothers to physically abuse infants. In this study, we
  attempt to explain variation in the neural response to infant crying among
  human fathers, with the hope of identifying factors that are associated with a
  more or less sensitive response. We imaged brain function in 39 first-time
  fathers of newborn infants as they listened to both their own and a
  standardized unknown infant cry stimulus, as well as auditory control stimuli,
  and evaluated whether these neural responses were correlated with measured
  characteristics of fathers and infants that were hypothesized to modulate
  these responses. Fathers also provided subjective ratings of each cry stimulus
  on multiple dimensions. Fathers showed widespread activation to both own and
  unknown infant cries in neural systems involved in empathy and approach
  motivation. There was no significant difference in the neural response to the
  own vs. unknown infant cry, and many fathers were unable to distinguish
  between the two cries. Comparison of these results with previous studies in
  mothers revealed a high degree of similarity between first-time fathers and
  first-time mothers in the pattern of neural activation to newborn infant
  cries. Further comparisons suggested that younger infant age was associated
  with stronger paternal neural responses, perhaps due to hormonal or novelty
  effects. In our sample, older fathers found infant cries less aversive and had
  an attenuated response to infant crying in both the dorsal anterior cingulate
  cortex (dACC) and the anterior insula, suggesting that compared with younger
  fathers, older fathers may be better able to avoid the distress associated
  with empathic over-arousal in response to infant cries. A principal components
  analysis revealed that fathers with more negative emotional reactions to the
  unknown infant cry showed decreased activation in the thalamus and caudate
  nucleus, regions expected to promote positive parental behaviors, as well as
  increased activation in the hypothalamus and dorsal ACC, again suggesting that
  empathic over-arousal might result in negative emotional reactions to infant
  crying. In sum, our findings suggest that infant age, paternal age and
  paternal emotional reactions to infant crying all modulate the neural response
  of fathers to infant crying. By identifying neural correlates of variation in
  paternal subjective reactions to infant crying, these findings help lay the
  groundwork for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions designed to
  increase paternal sensitivity and compassion.
