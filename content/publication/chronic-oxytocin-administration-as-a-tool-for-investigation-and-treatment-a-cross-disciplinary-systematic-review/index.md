abstract: Oxytocin (OT) subserves various physiological, behavioral, and
  cognitive processes. This paired with the ability to administer OT with
  minimal and inconsistent side effects has spurred research to explore its
  therapeutic potential. Findings from single-dose studies indicate that OT
  administration may be beneficial, at least under certain circumstances. The
  state of the field, however, is less clear regarding effects from chronic OT
  administration, which more closely resembles long-term treatment. To address
  this gap, this review synthesizes existing findings on the use of chronic OT
  administration in animal and human work. In addition to detailing the effects
  of chronic OT administration across different functional domains, this review
  highlights factors that have contributed to mixed findings. Based on this
  review, a basic framework of interrelated regulatory functions sensitive to
  chronic OT administration is offered. The paper also identifies future
  research directions across different contexts, populations, and outcomes,
  specifically calling for more systematic and standardized research on chronic
  OT administration in humans to supplement and expand what is currently known
  from preclinical work.
